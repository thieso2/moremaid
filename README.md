# Moremaid

A powerful Markdown viewer with full Mermaid diagram support. View your markdown files with beautifully rendered diagrams, syntax-highlighted code blocks, and a clean reading experience.

## ü§ñ About This Project

**This entire project was coded by Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), not by a human developer.** Every line of code, feature implementation, and architectural decision was created through AI-human collaboration. The human provided requirements and feedback, while Claude handled all the actual programming, debugging, and problem-solving.

## üîê Secure Document Sharing with --pack

Share sensitive documentation securely with Moremaid's encrypted archive feature:

```bash
# Pack your markdown files into an encrypted ZIP
mm --pack docs/

# Set a password when prompted
# Share the encrypted .zip file

# Recipients can browse without extraction
mm packed.zip
```

**Key Benefits:**
- üì¶ **Pack & Encrypt** - Bundle markdown files into password-protected ZIP archives
- üåê **Browse Without Extraction** - View encrypted content directly in browser, no temp files
- üîí **In-Memory Decryption** - Files stay encrypted on disk, decrypted only when viewed
- üöÄ **Zero Installation for Recipients** - Anyone with the password can view via `npx moremaid packed.zip`

Perfect for sharing confidential documentation, technical specs, or sensitive notes while maintaining security.

## Usage

### Command-Line Tool (Single File)

View any markdown file in your browser with a live server:

```bash
mm README.md                   # Starts server for single file
mm docs/api-documentation.md
mm ~/notes/meeting-notes.md

# With theme selection
mm README.md --theme github
mm file.md -t dracula
mm file.md --dark              # Shortcut for --theme dark

# Legacy mode: generate temp HTML and exit
mm README.md --oneshot
mm file.md -o
```

### Archive Mode (.moremaid Files)

Pack and share your markdown projects:

```bash
# Pack a directory into a .moremaid archive
mm --pack myproject/
mm --pack README.md            # Pack a single file
mm --pack docs/ --theme github # Pack with default theme

# View a .moremaid archive
mm project.moremaid             # Opens archive in browser
mm shared.zip                   # Also supports regular .zip files
```

    D --> B
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John
    John-->>Alice: Hi Alice
    Alice->>John: How are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
```

### Gantt Chart
```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Phase 1
    Task 1           :a1, 2024-01-01, 30d
    Task 2           :after a1, 20d
    section Phase 2
    Task 3           :2024-02-01, 12d
    Task 4           :24d
```

## Project Structure

```
moremaid/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mm.js              # CLI tool entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # NPM package configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ samples/           # Example markdown files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## Requirements

### CLI Tool
- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- NPM (comes with Node.js)

### Browser Support
- Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript must be enabled

## How It Works

### CLI Tool (Single File)
1. Creates a single-file virtual file system
2. Starts a local HTTP server
3. Automatically redirects to the file view
4. Renders markdown with Mermaid diagrams
5. Auto-cleanup when browser disconnects (default)
6. Use `--oneshot` for legacy temp file mode

### CLI Tool (Folder Mode)
1. Scans directory recursively for markdown files
2. Starts HTTP server on available port
3. Generates index page with file listing
4. Serves markdown files on demand
5. Renders with same quality as single-file mode
6. Handles navigation between files

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Tool Issues

**Error: "mm: command not found"**
- Make sure you've installed globally with `npm install -g`
- Or use `npx moremaid` instead
- Or run directly with `./mm.js`

**Browser doesn't open automatically**
- The HTML file is saved to your temp directory
- Look for the path in any error message
- Open the file manually if needed

### Server Issues

**Port already in use**
- The folder mode automatically finds an available port
- Use `PORT=3000 mm .` to specify a custom port

### Rendering Issues

**Mermaid diagrams not rendering**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Try refreshing the page

**Code highlighting not working**
- Some language aliases might not be recognized
- Try using the full language name (e.g., `javascript` instead of `js`)
